u-boot-arm64-ramfb.bin is a build of U-Boot
(http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/WebHome), (C) Wolfgang Denk and contributors
under the GPL 2.  See http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/Licensing for more details
on its license, and find its original source at
https://git.src.kameliya.ee/~kameliya/u-boot/log/qfw-ramfb.

u-boot-riscv64-ramfb.bin is the same.  Its source is at
https://git.src.kameliya.ee/~kameliya/u-boot/log/qfw-ramfb-riscv.  A build of
QEMU with fw_cfg and ramfb support for the riscv `virt' machine is required.
They are en-route to the tree, but until then can be found at
https://git.src.kameliya.ee/~kameliya/qemu/log/riscv-fw_cfg.
